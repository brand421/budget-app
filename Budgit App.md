# Budgit App


## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to create a type of budgeting app that utilizes version control, and showcase knowledge of front-end and back-end languages.  This app will be created using the MERN stack.

## Initial Thoughts
When figuring out what I wanted this app to be and do, a lot of questions popped into my head: "How comprehensive should this be?" "What is it going to look like?" "What level of customization should be afforded the user?" "Did I leave the stove on at home?" 

Before I even started I was getting feature creep!  However, instead of taking a step back, I dove head first into the project (This surely won't come back to bite me in the butt).

## First Challenge
I had never done a full stack app using the MERN stack.  I had a working knowledge of each language isolated and on it's own, however I had never combined them all to use in one application, so how that needed to be set up was my first challenge.  Thankfully the internet delivered and helped me figure this out (This will be a VERY common occurance for the duration of this project, I'm sure)!
